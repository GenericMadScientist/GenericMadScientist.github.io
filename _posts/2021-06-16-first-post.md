I've finally decided to make a blog. The primary motivation is that I want a
place to dump writeups about interesting things I find in video games, and
currently I tend to just keep the information as personal notes on my computer,
dump it to [my pastebin account][pastebin-account], or share it with one or two
people. I'd much rather have the information public and easily accessible, so
this is what I've decided to try. As a bonus over pastebin, I get to use the
magic of formatting.

The secondary motivation is it provides an excuse to hone two skills: writing
and web-dev. Nobody regretted getting better at writing, and reading about
web-dev is boring if I have nothing to apply it to. I'm not sure how much this
blog will help with the latter, but we'll see how it goes. And at any rate, I
can always migrate down the line if need be.

I don't have any plans on regular posts, I expect to just write something when
I have something to say. Maybe I'll look into some things in 
[Yu-Gi-Oh! Nightmare Troubadour][nightmare-troubadour] to start this off. We
shall see.
